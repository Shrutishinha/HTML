Resume Analyzer
Frontend Resume Evaluation System (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)
📌 Project Overview

Resume Analyzer is a lightweight, browser-based web application developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The system performs client-side, rule-based resume analysis to identify technical skills, evaluate keyword relevance, and generate structured feedback.

The application is fully frontend-based and does not rely on backend servers, artificial intelligence, machine learning, or third-party libraries. All processing occurs locally within the user’s browser, ensuring privacy, security, and offline accessibility.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in frontend engineering, client-side data handling, and UI development.

🚀 Core Features

Complete frontend implementation (no backend required)

Resume upload and manual text input

Keyword-based skill detection

ATS-oriented screening logic

Automated resume scoring system

Personalized improvement suggestions

Responsive and accessible interface

Offline functionality

Secure local processing

⚙️ System Architecture & Workflow

The resume analysis process is implemented using deterministic JavaScript logic:

Resume files are loaded using the FileReader API

Input text is normalized and preprocessed

Predefined skill dictionaries are applied

Keyword matching is performed

Scores are computed based on weighted metrics

Gaps and improvement areas are identified

Results are rendered dynamically on the interface

This architecture emphasizes performance, simplicity, and transparency.
